    <h1>Nike Customer Behavior Analysis</h1>
    <p>This project analyzes the purchasing behavior of customers across Nike Official and Nike Vintage business units.
        The goal is to understand patterns and trends in customer orders and to identify key insights that can drive
        business decisions.</p>
     <h2>Tableau Visualization</h2>

    <h2>Analysis Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Question 1: Top Customers by Total Revenue</h3>
            <p>Identify the top customers by the total amount of revenue (aggregate of the sales price) for the combined
                Nike Official and Nike Vintage business units. Include the customer ID, total revenue, and the number of
                order items each customer has purchased. Only include orders that have not been cancelled or returned.
            </p>

                Techniques Used:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Table Expression (CTE)</strong>: Used to combine order items from both Nike
                        Official and Nike Vintage into a common table (`comon_table`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: COUNT and SUM functions to calculate the total number of orders
                        and total revenue per user in `rev_user_table`.</li>
                    <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: To filter out orders that have been cancelled or returned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ordering</strong>: Results are ordered by total revenue in descending order.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Question 2: Customer Segmentation by Purchasing Behavior</h3>
            <p>Segment customers into three segments:
            <ul>
                <li>Customers that only purchased a single product.</li>
                <li>Customers that purchased more than one product.</li>
                <li>“Missing Data” (if none of these conditions match).</li>
            </ul>
            Determine the number of customers and the total revenue (aggregate of the sales price) in each segment. Only
            include orders that have not been cancelled or returned.</p>

                    <li><strong>Conditional Aggregation</strong>: SUM CASE WHEN to categorize customers based on their
                        purchasing behavior in `temp_product`.</li>
                    <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: To filter out orders that have been cancelled or returned.</li>
                    <li><strong>UNION ALL</strong>: To combine datasets from different sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grouping and Aggregation</strong>: Grouping by customer segments and summing up revenues
                        and counts.</li>

            <h3>Question 3: Revenue Distribution by State</h3>
            <p>Analyze the percentage of total revenue per state that comes from the Nike Official business. Create a
                list showing the total revenue per state, the revenue from Nike Official, and the percentage of Nike
                Official revenue compared to the total revenue for each state. Only include orders that have not been
                cancelled or returned. Order the results by the state with the highest total revenue first.</p>

                    <li><strong>COALESCE</strong>: Used to handle missing state data by assigning a default value ('Miss
                        Data') in `customer_table`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: SUM function to calculate total revenues in `tr_table` and
                        `nor_table`.</li>
                    <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: To join tables and ensure only completed and returned orders are
                        included.</li>
                    <li><strong>Percentage Calculation</strong>: Calculated the percentage of Nike Official revenue to
                        total revenue.</li>

            <h3>Question 4: Order Status Summary by State</h3>
            <p>Create an overview of orders by state. Summarize the number of orders with statuses of Complete or
                Canceled (Returned or Cancelled) for each customer. Exclude orders that are still in progress
                (Processing or Shipped) and only include orders for customers that have a state available.</p>

                    <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: To join tables and ensure the correct mapping of customers to their
